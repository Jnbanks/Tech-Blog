## Installation
Make sure you have VS Code installed, as well as Nodejs. Clone this repo onto your computer and open this file. Once open, open the integrated terminal in VS Code and type npm i and the necessary packages/dependencies will be installed. 

## Usage
Start by creating an account on the main page, then access your profile. On the profile you will see two input fields, one for your blog title and the other for it's content body. Fill these in with whatever you would like to share and click submit. If you would like to edit them simply edit them in the input field boxes below and click submit. The same goes for deleting them. If you would like to see other people's posts go to the home page by clicking the home text in the navbar. There is a comment input field below each post. This function is not currently active but it would allow for leaving comments on any blog post.
